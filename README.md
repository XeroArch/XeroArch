## What is XeroArch?

Well configured, just with the necessary software for things like, audio, bluetooth, wi-fi, Nvidia or AMD drivers etc..
Custom repositories, a few extra useful utilities like a pdf-viewer, timeshift, AUR-helpers, supergfxctl(switch graphics card modes), switcheroo-control(run specific programs with discrete GPU) etc..

XeroArch is an ArchLinux distro, but made for simplicity and normal ease of use. Now if you want to play video-games, you just have to download our custom pkg with all the wine dependencies and gaming applications to have a proper gaming experience:
"sudo pacman -S xeroarch-gaming-meta" <--(put it in your terminal).

If you don't want to use the terminal you can use the "Add/Remove Software" app, search for: "xeroarch-gaming-meta", and install it with a GUI pkg manager.

NOTE: Download the latest version to avoid errors in the online installation mode, the previous wasn't updated to pacman-7, which was causing that issue.
